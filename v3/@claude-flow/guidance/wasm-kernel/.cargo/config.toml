# WASM SIMD Configuration
#
# Enables WASM SIMD128 instructions for vectorized operations.
# Node.js 16+ supports WASM SIMD. Falls back gracefully on older runtimes.
#
# To build with SIMD (default for this project):
#   wasm-pack build --target nodejs --release
#
# To build without SIMD (maximum compatibility):
#   RUSTFLAGS="" wasm-pack build --target nodejs --release
#
# SIMD benefits:
# - regex crate uses SIMD for string scanning (Aho-Corasick, memchr)
# - sha2 crate can use SIMD for SHA-256 compression
# - Overall 1.5-3x speedup on regex-heavy workloads
